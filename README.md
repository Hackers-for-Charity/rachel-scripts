Hackers for Charity (http://hackersforcharity.org) is a non-profit organization that leverages the skills of technologists. We solve technology challenges for various non-profits and provide food, equipment, job training and computer education to the world's poorest citizens.

If you’re wondering why a bunch of hackers are into education, read the blog post titled "Why Education?" (http://www.hackersforcharity.org/education/why-education/).

We’ve spent a lot of time and energy trying to find the best free education solutions. We wrapped them in a package that’s rugged, resilient and relevant, a Pelican case loaded with small Raspberry Pi server and power management components along with the “Loaded” Chromebook. This system is designed to provide world-class educational curriculum and resources to off-grid areas that need them the most. Completely self-contained, the system is completely battery-operated and contains material from Khan Academy, Wikipedia, The Goodwill Community Foundation, CK-12, Project Gutenberg, Hesperian and more. At approximately $250 per seat, this system is an affordable way to add an electronic library and a wealth of training material to any school, anywhere.

The is a repository of working documents to support the software builds.
